To Start project

1) npm install
2) npm start

how i document my frontend code
1) usually a create a file called style guide in my  base directory
where every thing there is commented out

then i proceed by writing out this things 
a) the css architure used
b) the coding convention applied
c) the file structure
d) naming practise


2. My thoughts on frontend testing
i think testing is a crucial part of development because
1) it helps to ensure projects are easily maintainable
2) it helps to catch bugs a developer might have easily missed
3) it helps to be sure a piece of code does what exactly it was suppoded to do.

3. Design patterns for react aplications include

1) Building reusable componeents
2) condition rendering
3) controlled props

4. Tyscript being a statically typed lanuage helps to catch bugs a developer might easily miss because if a wrong type is retured it fails to compile. sometimes i think its a bit more stressful that javascript because of its initail configuration but its totally worth it to a developer that has spent hours debugging on to discover the 2 he is returning is actually a "2"

5. i think its the issue of rendering and state management

6. mostly it is determined by 
1) the ui e.g how many number of components can i reuse
2) the size of the project e,g is it a big, medium or small project 
3) the complexity of the project
